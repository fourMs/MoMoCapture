Participation in the project is voluntary. If you choose to participate, you can withdraw your consent at any time without giving a reason. All your data will then be deleted. There will be no negative consequences if you decide to withdraw. To withdraw, contact <a href=\"mailto:a.r.jensenius&#64;imv.uio.no\">a.r.jensenius&#64;imv.uio.no</a><u>.</u></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p><strong>Procedure: </strong>Being a participant with the MusicLab App involves installing the mobile application that records your movement and responding to questionnaires before and after music listening or performances. Your movement will be recorded using your phone’s gyroscope, accelerometer, and location. During motion recording, you should place your phone somewhere on your body. For the best results, try to place it somewhere near your chest, such as by placing it in a shirt pocket or by making a necklace with tape and string. The questionnaires are delivered using the mobile application’s pre- and post-form tabs.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p><strong>Risks and Benefits: </strong>Dancing to music may require some space and basic physical coordination. Please make sure that your environment is clear of obstacles that could harm you while you move to music. There are no monetary benefits to participation, however you may enjoy the music, or you may feel content from contributing to the advancement of music science.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p><strong>Duration of MusicLab App Project: </strong>MusicLab is an ongoing project, without a defined end time. MusicLab is based on the principles of Open Science, in which the aim is to make data publicly available for reuse.
